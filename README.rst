Standalone version of `pycddlib <https://pypi.org/project/pycddlib/>`_.

This package provides the :mod:`cdd` module of pycddlib (but not :mod:`cddgmp`).
It can be compiled from the source distribution without needing cddlib or gmp installed,
and is suitable for installation of pycddlib on systems where cddlib and/or gmp
cannot be installed for whatever reason (for instance, google colab).
